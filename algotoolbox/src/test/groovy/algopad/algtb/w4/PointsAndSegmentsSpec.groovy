@Narrative('''You are organizing an online lottery. To participate, a person bets on a single
              integer. You then draw several ranges of consecutive integers at random.
              A participant’s payoff then is proportional to the number of ranges that
              contain the participant’s number minus the number of ranges that does not
              contain it. You need an efficient algorithm for computing the payoffs for all
              participants. A naive way to do this is to simply scan, for all participants, the
              list of all ranges. However, you lottery is very popular: you have thousands
              of participants and thousands of ranges. For this reason, you cannot afford
              a slow naive algorithm.''')
