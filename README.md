# Algopad
A scratchpad of coding exercises focusing on algorithms

Most of the code will be written in Groovy, but occasionally Java or Python will be used,
and Scala whenever I get around to learning it.

Each module gathers various exercises for varying sources. They are summarized here :

- algorithms  : Algorithms pt.1 & 2 (Princeton, Coursera)
- algoprog    : Algorithms and Programming, 2nd edition (A. Shen)
- algotoolbox : Algorithmic Toolbox (UC San Diego, Coursera)
- algodsgn2   : Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2 (Stanford, Coursera)
- geeks       : http://www.geeksforgeeks.org
