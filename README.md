# Algopad
A scratchpad of coding exercises focusing on algorithms

Most of the code will be written in Groovy, but occasionnally Java or Python will be used, and Scala whenever I get around to learning it.

Each module gathers various exercises for varying sources. They are summarized here :

- careercup : http://www.careercup.com
- algoprog  : Algorithms and Programming, 2nd edition (A. Shen)

If you have any remarks feel free to drop me a line ;)
